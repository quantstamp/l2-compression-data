## Sample Data

This repository contains _sample_ data for the work carried out in the main [Evaluating Rollup 
Compression](https://github.com/quantstamp/l2-compression) repository. The real data was collected from (pre-Bedrock) 
[Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) batches posted on Ethereum from block [16250000](https://etherscan.io/block/162500000) (23 
Dec 2022) to [16350000](https://etherscan.io/block/16350000) (6 January 2023). The data contained 5.3 GB of batches stored as 
hexadecimal strings, like those in this repository. It included 42,888 batches which contained 7,139,55 transactions. The real 
data is too large to share via a GitHub repository.
